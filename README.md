# Project Title

This Pet-project is focused on practical implementation of SpringSecurity and JWTauth techonologies.


## Structure

This project is based around several basic endpoints for Keys, Locks and also the initial webpage endpoint. Their functionality if of no direct interest.

The main focus of the project was to get practical understanding of security technologies offered by Spring Boot, such as Spring Security and JWT Auth.

Eventually, the JWT Auth authentication was implemented to protect the endpoint for Keys, Locks (only Admin type account can access this endpoint). The initial webpage is accessible without authorization, as well as the webpage for User Registration.

After User Registration, navigate to the endpoint for Token/Refresh Token acquisition.

Afterwards, use the Refresh Token to acquire new access token after the old one expires.
